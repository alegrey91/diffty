# RFC: diffty - Git Diff Visualization and Review Tracking Tool

## Introduction
diffty is a web-based tool designed to streamline code review processes by providing enhanced diff visualization and lightweight review workflows for large pull requests. The tool focuses on developer ergonomics with keyboard-driven navigation while maintaining compatibility with standard Git workflows.

## Scope
This document covers the architecture, functionality, and implementation details for a system that:
- Compares Git branches with rich visual diffs
- Maintains review state across sessions
- Provides keyboard-centric interaction
- Supports common development formats

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Branch Comparison
**1.1 Branch Selection**
- Users must be able to select any two branches from the target repository
- Branch list populated via `git branch` command

**1.2 Diff Generation**
- Uses `git diff` with unified diff format under the hood
- Excludes binary files from comparison

### 2. Diff Visualization
**2.1 Display Modes**
- Side-by-side comparison view
- Inline unified diff view
- Syntax highlighting for supported languages (§5.1)

**2.2 Line Annotation**
- Visual indicators for line operations:
  - `+` Added (green)
  - `-` Removed (red)
  - `~` Modified (yellow)
- Line numbers from both file versions

### 3. Review Workflow
**3.1 State Management**
| State      | Keyboard Shortcut | Persistence |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Approved   | `a`              | JSON        |
| Rejected   | `r`              | JSON        |
| Skipped    | `s`              | JSON        |

**3.2 Navigation**
- Arrow keys: Move between files/diff sections

### 4. Persistence
**4.1 Storage Layout**
```
$HOME/.diffty/
  └─ repository/
      └─ source-commit-hash/
          └─ target-commit-hash/
              └─ review-state.json
```

**4.2 Data Structure**
```
{
  "reviewed_files": [
    {
      "repo": "/path/to/repo",
      "path": "src/main.go",
      "lines": {
        "42": "approved",
        "57-63": "skipped"
      }
    }
  ],
  "source_branch": "feature",
  "target_branch": "main",
  "source_commit": "abc123",
  "target_commit": "def456"
}
```

## Technical Specifications

### 5. Architecture
**5.1 Backend**
- Go
- Git

**5.2 Frontend**
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- HTML templates rendered server-side

**5.3 Server Architecture**
- HTTP server using Go's standard library
- MVC-like pattern with clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- HTML templates for page rendering

**5.4 Component Design**
- **Server**: Core HTTP server and request handling
- **Git**: Git repository operations wrapper
- **Storage**: State persistence and retrieval
- **Models**: Data structures and business logic

**5.5 Package Structure**
```
diffty/
  ├─ cmd/
  │   └─ diffty/           # Command-line entry point
  ├─ internal/
  │   ├─ git/              # Git operations
  │   ├─ models/           # Data models
  │   ├─ server/           # HTTP server

  │   └─ storage/          # Persistence layer
  └─ rfcs/                 # Design documents
```

### 6. Testing
**6.1 Test Coverage**
- Unit tests for core functionality in each package:
  - `git`: Repository and Git operations tests
  - `storage`: File persistence and data serialization tests
  - `server`: HTTP handlers and request processing tests

**6.2 Test Architecture**
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- HTTP testing using Go's httptest package
- Runtime test suite can be executed with `go test ./...`

### 7. Error Handling
**7.1 Error Propagation**
- Errors are logged and propagated to the UI
- Custom error pages with user-friendly messages
- Graceful fallbacks for non-critical errors

**7.2 Debugging Features**
- Comprehensive request logging for troubleshooting
- Structured error messages with context
- Request details are captured for diagnostics

**7.3 User Experience**
- User-friendly error pages with clear messages
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Navigation options to return to a safe state

### 8. Security Considerations
**8.1 Input Validation**
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Path traversal prevention for repository access
- Query parameter validation

**8.2 Resource Limitations**
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

### 9. Templating System
**9.1 Layout Approach**
- Base layout template with content placeholders
- Content templates rendered into layout
- Partials for reusable components

**9.2 Template Functions**
- Custom template functions for:
  - String manipulation (hasPrefix, etc.)
  - Math operations (add, sub)
  - Collection operations (index, len)

### 10. Extension Points
**10.1 Plugins**
- Future support for visualization plugins
- Hooks for custom diff processing
- Integration points with external systems

**10.2 Configuration**
- Command-line flags for basic configuration
- Environment variable overrides
- Future support for configuration files
